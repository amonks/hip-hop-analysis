# Some thoughts on Eric B and Rakim's *Follow The Leader*

## Intro

Eric B and Rakim's *Follow The Leader* is an anthem of movement. Every piece of the song comes together to convey a forward-moving, desperately urgent feeling, as if R is running through the streets (or, you know, "around the universe") and we're frantically chasing him. Following his words and his rhythms.

## Eric B's Part

### Rhythm Section

In my opinion, *Follow The Leader* is completely carried by a standout beat by Eric B. It opens with a beautiful, kinda-TB-303-sounding bassline that the New York Times at the time called, ["Space Age"](http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/09/arts/sounds-around-town-851988.html). The line (and the song) are unusually fast for hip-hop, clocking in at a steady 110bpm. The bassline uses two sequences of short 16th notes, first from the 1 to the 2, then from the 3 to the 4. The quick repeated notes give the bassline a driving quality, further emphasized by the short length of the looped pattern. 

The beat comes in quickly, with single bar intro that transitions elegantly into a looped percussion sample from Coke Escovedo's *I Wouldn't Change A Thing*. The sample features heavy use of open high hats, twice per bar, first between 1 and 2, then between 3 and 4. This intefaces well with the repeated bass loop, further emphasizing the forward drive of the fast beat. 

### Samples

On top of the rhythm section, Eric B peppers in two more instrumental samples throughout the song. First, a repeated horn riff from Baby Huey's *Listen To Me*. Again, the horn is precicely selected to work with the rhythm of the bassline, coming in on the 2, the pickup to the 4, and the 4 itself. The sample's time-stretched very slightly, giving the horn a subtly ethereal sound. 

Doubling down on ethereal, Eric B introduces a string sample from Bob James' classic *Nautilus*. Nautilus has since been heavily oversampled, ([189 times](http://www.whosampled.com/Bob-James/Nautilus/), by WhoSampled's count), so in order to see if the song meets this somewhat-absurd metric of originality, I checked to see who was first. Prior to 1988, when *Follow The Leader* came out, Nautilus had apparently already been used a handful of times by artists such as Ultramagnetic MCs, Ice-T, and Geto Boys. 

Anyway, the *Nautilus* sample is of an electric keyboard using a soft, mysterious tone. It quickly moves into a string line, to which Eric has added a distortion making it sound very digital/artificial/futuristic. A strong reverb adds to the acidic spaceyness. The sound evokes a 50s-style theremin-backed alien invasion, almost, but when combined with the moving vibes of the rest of the beat, it creates a feeling more like leaving on a spaceship. 

### Chorus

Eric B uses a Primo-style chorus: an interlude featuring turntablism and vocal samples over the same beat that drives the verses; rather than a separate recorded section. In this case, I think the style of chorus serves to add to the forward motion of the song that I keep talking about. By continuing the same beat, rather than a separate chorus-beat-section, Eric avoids breaking up the movement. He keeps the chorus short, quickly returning to Rakim's steady flow.

## Rakim's Part

Lyrically, *Follow The Leader* comes from a time when people were just barely starting to say thoughtful things in rap music. It shows. Content-wise, the song is pretty empty, replete with boastfulness and signifying. In a couple instances, R flirts with content by incorporating a vague theme of enlightenment. In one short snippet near the end of his second verse, R reveals through reference that the enlightenment to which you might follow him is found within the Five Percent Nation:

>	God by nature, mind raised in Asia /
>	Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya /
>	From the cradle to the grave /
>	But remember - you're not a slave 

Five Percenters believe that God is the Asiatic Blackman, that 85% of the world has been misled or "tricked" by a malicious 10% to believe that god *isn't* the Asiatic Blackman, and that it's up to the remaining 5% of the world (the Poor Religious Teachers of the Five Percent Nation) to open eyes. Read within the context of this segment, the whole song becomes a call to follow Rakim's lead and join the Five Percenters. Fortunately, what Rakim lacks in lyrical content, he makes up for with wordplay and clever rhymes.
