<h1>Some thoughts on Eric B and Rakim&#39;s <em>Follow The Leader</em></h1>

<p>Upon reading this, it&#39;s pretty clear how I divide my admiration between Eric B and Rakim...</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Eric B and Rakim&#39;s <em>Follow The Leader</em> is an anthem of movement. Every piece of the song comes together to convey a forward-moving, desperately urgent feeling, as if R is running through the streets (or, you know, &quot;around the universe&quot;) and we&#39;re frantically chasing him. Following his words and his rhythms.</p>

<h2>Eric B&#39;s Part</h2>

<h3>Rhythm Section</h3>

<p>In my opinion, <em>Follow The Leader</em> is completely carried by a standout beat by Eric B. It opens with a beautiful, kinda-TB-303-sounding bassline that the New York Times at the time called, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/09/arts/sounds-around-town-851988.html">&quot;Space Age&quot;</a>. The line (and the song) are unusually fast for hip-hop, clocking in at a steady 110bpm. The bassline uses two sequences of short 16th notes, first from the 1 to the 2, then from the 3 to the 4. The quick repeated notes give the bassline a driving quality, further emphasized by the short length of the looped pattern. </p>

<p>The beat comes in quickly, with single bar intro that transitions elegantly into a looped percussion sample from Coke Escovedo&#39;s <em>I Wouldn&#39;t Change A Thing</em>. The sample features heavy use of open high hats, twice per bar, first between 1 and 2, then between 3 and 4. This interfaces well with the repeated bass loop, further emphasizing the forward drive of the fast beat. </p>

<h3>Samples</h3>

<p>On top of the rhythm section, Eric B peppers in two more instrumental samples throughout the song. First, a repeated horn riff from Baby Huey&#39;s <em>Listen To Me</em>. Again, the horn is precisely selected to work with the rhythm of the bassline, coming in on the 2, the pickup to the 4, and the 4 itself. The sample&#39;s time-stretched very slightly, giving the horn a subtly ethereal sound. </p>

<p>Doubling down on ethereal, Eric B introduces a string sample from Bob James&#39; classic <em>Nautilus</em>. Nautilus has since been heavily oversampled, (<a href="http://www.whosampled.com/Bob-James/Nautilus/">189 times</a>, by WhoSampled&#39;s count), so in order to see if the song meets this somewhat-absurd metric of originality, I checked to see who was first. Prior to 1988, when <em>Follow The Leader</em> came out, Nautilus had apparently already been used a handful of times by artists such as Ultramagnetic MCs, Ice-T, and Geto Boys. </p>

<p>Anyway, the <em>Nautilus</em> sample is of an electric keyboard using a soft, mysterious tone. It quickly moves into a string line, to which Eric has added a distortion making it sound very digital/artificial/futuristic. A strong reverb adds to the acidic spaceyness. The sound evokes a 50s-style theremin-backed alien invasion, almost, but when combined with the moving vibes of the rest of the beat, it creates a feeling more like leaving on a spaceship. </p>

<h3>Chorus</h3>

<p>Eric B uses a Primo-style chorus: an interlude featuring turntablism and vocal samples over the same beat that drives the verses; rather than a separate recorded section. In this case, I think the style of chorus serves to add to the forward motion of the song that I keep talking about. By continuing the same beat, rather than a separate chorus-beat-section, Eric avoids breaking up the movement. He keeps the chorus short, quickly returning to Rakim&#39;s steady flow.</p>

<h2>Rakim&#39;s Part</h2>

<p>Lyrically, <em>Follow The Leader</em> comes from a time when people were just barely starting to say thoughtful things in rap music. It shows. Content-wise, the song is pretty empty, replete with boastfulness and signifying.</p>

<h3>Nation of Islam bullshit</h3>

<p>In a couple instances, R flirts with content by incorporating a vague theme of enlightenment. In one short snippet near the end of his second verse, R reveals through reference that the enlightenment to which you might follow him is found within the Five Percent Nation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God by nature, mind raised in Asia /
  Since you was tricked, I have to raise ya /
  From the cradle to the grave /
  But remember - you&#39;re not a slave </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Five Percenters believe that God is the Asiatic Blackman, that 85% of the world has been misled or &quot;tricked&quot; by a malicious 10% to believe that god <em>isn&#39;t</em> the Asiatic Blackman, and that it&#39;s up to the remaining 5% of the world (the Poor Religious Teachers of the Five Percent Nation) to open eyes. Read within the context of this segment, the whole song becomes a call to follow Rakim&#39;s lead and join the Five Percenters. Fortunately, what Rakim lacks in lyrical content, he makes up for with wordplay and clever rhymes. </p>

<h3>Beef</h3>

<p>One interesting historical tidbit contained within the song is its references to short-lived beef between Rakim and EPMD&#39;s Erick Sermon. In his 1987 track, <em>I Ain&#39;t No Joke</em>, Rakim used the lines, </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Play ‘em, so I’mma have to dis and broke /
  You could get a smack for this, I ain&#39;t no joke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In their debut single, a year later, EPMD used the lines,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a diggum smack /
  Smack me and I&#39;ll smack you back</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because of the similar use of the word &quot;smack&quot;, R&#39;s fans took EPMD&#39;s (actually cereal-referencing line) as a comeback diss, a response to Rakim&#39;s own verse, and goaded Rakim into retaliating on <em>Follow The Leader</em>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop buggin&#39; a brother said dig him, I never dug him
  He couldn&#39;t follow the leader long enough so I drug him</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m not entirely sure how this constitutes a retaliation. I can&#39;t find a specific reference within this line to EPMD, but Erick Sermon disagrees, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRh_Njm4pS0">saying</a> that the line was Rakim&#39;s attempt at &quot;destroying [EPMD].&quot; He later told NAS the story, and NAS summarized it in his 2004 track, <em>UBR (Unauthorized Biography of Rakim),</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>EPMD put a record out, was dope /
  Tension spread, and I quote &quot;Smack me and I smack you back&quot; /
  Sounded like the answer to the I Ain&#39;t No Joke track</p>
</blockquote>
