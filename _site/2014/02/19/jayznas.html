<h1>Some thoughts on the Jay-Z vs. Nas beef, as characterized by <em>Ether</em> and <em>Takeover</em></h1>

<p>The most recent version of this paper will probably always be available on Github at <a href="https://github.com/amonks/hip-hop-analysis/blob/master/jayz-nas.md">this link</a></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>One of the most notable historical &#39;beefs&#39; in hip-hop, now resolved, was between Nas and Jay-Z. The beef heated up over the early 2000s, officially concluding in 2006. It spawned a number of classic diss tracks, most notably including <em>Ether</em>, <em>Takeover</em>, <em>Got Ur Self A</em>, and <em>Supa Ugly</em>.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>When Biggie died in 1997, New York needed a new king. The primary contenders were Nas and Jay-Z.</p>

<p>Through the 90s, Nas was a darling of the NYC Hip Hop scene. He achieved huge commercial and critical success, beginning with his standout debut album, <em>Illmatic</em>. However, by the late 90s, the quality of his output had started to fade, and 1999&#39;s <em>Nastradamus</em> was pretty terrible, especially in comparison to his earlier work.</p>

<p>Jay was a relative newcomer: he made his debut in 1996 with <em>Reasonable Doubt</em>, to this day his strongest album, but by 1999 he had surpassed Nas&#39; sales, and his label, Roc-A-Fella, dominated urban contemporary radio. Both he and Nas were formidable rappers, well positioned to take the throne.</p>

<p>The tension started to heat up, when Prodigy, a member of Mobb Deep and a good friend of Nas&#39;, perceived that Jay-Z was disrespecting his Queensbridge compatriot. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z%E2%80%93Nas_feud">Wikipedia</a> quotes Prodigy as saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So when I heard that, I was like, “Who is Jay talking about who is talking about hanging in Marcy in they line?” Then I thought about “Trife Life” in my verse I said “jetted through Marcy ‘cause D’s[detectives] ain’t baggin’ me” because I was out there...Then “Shook Ones” came out, then Jay came with the plastic cups, football jerseys in the projects, taking jabs at us. I was like Nas, what we need to do is go at these niggas because number one, his lil’ man is trying to shit on you; talking about your life is written and all this shit.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>While Nas kept quiet, Prodigy slowly escalated the beef, repeatedly taking shots in interviews at Jay-Z and the Roc-A-Fella roster. Eventually, in 2001, Jay-Z kicked things up a notch and debuted <em>Takeover</em>, the debut single off of his acclaimed 6th album, <em>The Blueprint</em>, at <em>Hot 97</em>&#39;s 2001 Summer Jam, where his historical performance even included an <a href="http://www.defjam.com/from-the-vault-jay-z-brings-out-michael-jackson-at-2001-hot97fm-summer-jam/">appearance by Michael Jackson</a>. The track is a direct diss track, targeting both Prodigy and Nas, and the first album track to come out of the feud.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, Nas came back with <em>Ether</em>, an even harder-hitting diss. The track was so fierce, that in the words of <a href="http://passionweiss.com/2012/09/11/the-25-greatest-outdated-rap-slang-words/">Son Raw</a>, whom Wikipedia deems credible enough to quote, “To &#39;ether&#39; someone means to completely dismantle them in a rap battle with no regard for petty concerns such as &#39;logic&#39; or &#39;cleverness&#39; – it’s a giant shock-n-awe display of machismo meant to scar the victim for life and leave an unmistakable blemish on his career.&quot; The track revived Nas&#39; career, and and <em>he</em> headlined <em>Hot 97</em>&#39;s Summer Jam in 2002 and 2003.</p>

<h2>Takeover</h2>

<p>The earliest-dated Kanye West production in my iTunes library, Takeover came out on September 11, 2001. Lauded by Complex as the <a href="http://www.complex.com/music/2011/06/the-50-best-hip-hop-diss-songs/jay-z-takeover-2001">Best Diss Track Of All Time</a>. The track features an almost Dilla-level-prominent bassline sampled from The Doors&#39; <em>Five To One</em>, slowed down a bit and with some crazy saturator/limiter action to heat it up.</p>

<p>The beat is notable for Kanye&#39;s extremely pointed use of vocal samples. The third verse makes especially creative use of David Bowie&#39;s <em>Fame</em> as a foreground element: the sampled word &#39;fame,&#39; edited to sound like &#39;lame,&#39; is interspersed through Jay&#39;s lyrics, for example, &quot;That&#39;s why your [&quot;LAAAAAAME&quot; sample] career&#39;s come to an end.&quot;</p>

<p>Lyrically, the verses divide the song into thematic sections. Jay spends the first verse signifying, with bombastic lines like, &quot;God MC - me - Jay-hova // Hey lil soldier, you ain&#39;t ready for war // R.O.C. too strong for y&#39;all.&quot; I see this as a pump-up verse, getting ready for the divisive verses to follow.</p>

<p>The second verse focuses on Mobb Deep, and feels to me like another warm-up to the Nas part. Not to say Jay didn&#39;t go in: it effectively ended the meaningful phase in Mobb Deep&#39;s career. Their next album, <em>Infamy</em>, prominently featured two Jay-Z disses, attempted to replace their grimy sound with a poppier aesthetic, and generally wasn&#39;t good.</p>

<p>The fresh use of the aforementioned <em>Fame</em> samples draw attention to the third verse, the song&#39;s longest and most interesting. Jay spends the verse dissecting Nas. Interestingly, in lines like, &quot;Had a spark when you started but now you&#39;re just garbage,&quot; Jay several times acknowledges the greatness of <em>Illmatic</em>. This makes his argument stronger: <em>Illmatic</em> really is a classic, and to dispute that would make Jay&#39;s other claims less credible; by bringing attention to Nas&#39; early greatness, Jay makes his diss all the more poignant.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You said you&#39;ve been in this 10, I&#39;ve been in it 5 - smarten up, Nas //
 4 albums in 10 years, nigga? I could divide //
 That&#39;s one every...let&#39;s say 2 //
 2 of them shits was due //
 1 was &quot;nah,&quot; the other was Illmatic //
 That&#39;s a one-hot-album-every-10-year average</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Ether</h2>

<p>Ether was produced by Ron Browz. The beat employs a digital production aesthetic, using programmed drums and synthesizers and no samples after the opening. It opens with some gunshots, directly from <em>Who Shot Ya</em>, and a sample of the line &quot;Fuck Jay-Z&quot; from Tupac&#39;s not-even-a-diss-song, <em>Fuck Friendz</em>.</p>

<p>Like <em>Takeover</em>, <em>Ether</em> starts slow. The first verse is about how Nas is cool, and the second verse is about how Jay-Z is lame, and neither contains much more specific content than that. </p>

<p>In the 32-bar third verse, however, Nas goes into specifics. If <em>Takeover</em> stuck to one main argument (&#39;you used to be good and now you are bad&#39;), <em>Ether</em> does the opposite, using a shotgun-approach to bombard the Jay-Z and the Roc family with specific targeted callouts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jay Z hangs out with commercially successful artists to capitalize on their success</p></li>
<li><p>Foxy Brown only featured on &quot;Ain&#39;t No Nigga&quot; because of a secret affair between her and Jay (which she later confirmed)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;[Jay Z] traded [his] soul for riches&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Jay Z steals rhymes from the late, great, Biggie Smalls</p></li>
<li><p>Jay Z hates women</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Much like Jay&#39;s argument in Takeover, these callouts are all pretty correct. <em>Ether</em> and <em>Takeover</em> both have gone on to be recognized as some of the best diss tracks in hip hop. While both rappers have continued on to have successful and long-lasting careers, Jay-Z is still a corporate shill, and Nas still hasn&#39;t had an album better than Illmatic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think the most interesting thing that came out of these two songs is the semi-beef between Kanye West and Ron Brows. In an interview with <em>XXL</em>, Ron re-contextualized the beef as sampling-vs-synthesis, amusingly attempting to de-legitimize sampling and discredit a huge part of Hip-Hop&#39;s history:</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come on. I did that from scratch. Kanye sampled it. Come on. My mother can go in the house and listen to a record, chop that, chop that and make that. You know I heard Kanye when he was saying that, “How can people compare them?” I did that from scratch, the keyboard, a drum machine, my drum patterns. That’s me playing the keyboard with the strings and all the additional percussion. And it was hard. That’s a sample. Come on, anybody can do that. Is y’all playing? “Yo, it’s better.” Nah. I mean, I don’t know who produced [“Takeover”]. Kanye know, man. He know deep in his heart what beat is harder. And you can just do a survey.</p>

<p>I think Kanye West and Ron Brows&#39; respective careers settle issue pretty conclusively.</p>
