<h1>Some thoughts on Black Star&#39;s <em>Respiration</em></h1>

<p>The most recent version of this paper will probably always be available on Github at <a href="https://github.com/amonks/hip-hop-analysis/blob/master/respiration.md">this link</a></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Black Star&#39;s classic single <em>Respiration</em> deals with city life, both in New York, as told my Mos Def and Talib Kweli, and in Chicago, as told by Common. Like the other classics on <em>…Are Black Star</em>, Respiration was produced by Hi-Tek using a sample from <em>The Fox</em>, by Don Randi.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<h3>Within the album</h3>

<p>The track follows <em>Yo Yeah</em> on the record, a somewhat odd J Rawls interlude which concludes with some spoken words from an older gentleman:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;3:30 in the morning with not a soul in sight /
  We sat four deep at a traffic light /
  Talking about how dumb and brainwashed some of our brothers and sisters are /
  While we waited for a green light to tell us when to go&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I normally wouldn&#39;t talk about the previous song in a song analysis, but in this case, I think how it sets off the first 9 tracks from the last 3 makes it function somewhat like an intro, funneling the focus of the album down from broad politicized themes of pan-Africanism, black unity, and nonviolence down to explication of personal experience. I&#39;m not sure how well <em>Thieves In The Night</em> fits in with this &#39;funnel&#39;-reading, but for the purposes of this essay I&#39;m just gonna kinda hand-wave that away.</p>

<p>The gentleman in <em>Yo Yeah</em> brings ironic attention to a division in the black community, between the older generations and the youth. He complains that the youth are dumb and brainwashed, while waiting for a light at an empty intersection: a gesture that could perhaps only be motivated by desire to conform to the laws of society, for better or for worse. I feel a comparison here between this older gentleman and Hendrix&#39; <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/if-6-was-9-lyrics-jimi-hendrix.html">&quot;white collar conservative&quot;</a>: both illustrate different sides of the same generational gap. In Jimi&#39;s, the intent is to widen the gap, inspiring nonconformity in a younger generation. J Rawls&#39; example does the opposite—it serves to show that the gap might not be as wide as one thinks, instead calling for unity.</p>

<h3>Style Wars</h3>

<p><em>Yo Yeah</em> cuts directly to the beginning of <em>Respiration</em>, which opens with a sample from the seminal hip hop film, <em>Style Wars</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What&#39;d you do last night?&quot; /
  &quot;We did umm, two whole cars
  It was me, Dez, and Main Three right?
  And on the first car in small letters it said
  &#39;All you see is..&#39; and then you know
  Big, big, you know some block silver letters
  That said &#39;..crime in the city&#39; right?&quot; /
  &quot;It just took up the whole car?&quot; /
  &quot;Yeah yeah, it was a whole car and shit...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this clip, Skeme, a pioneer in New York&#39;s graffiti scene, speaks about his piece <em>Crime In The City</em>, pictured above. Like the best vocal samples, Skeme&#39;s poignant words here signify a great deal more than they may initially appear to. In <em>Crime</em>, Skeme has created a double meaning: the piece can be read to mean something like &#39;all the city has to offer is crime&#39;, but it can also be read to mean something like &#39;when <em>you</em> see the city, <em>you</em> miss the beauty for the crime&#39;.</p>

<p>This double meaning ties directly into the a fundamental struggle of hip-hop culture, and arguably of Black American culture on the whole: perception. If the four pillars of hip hop can be defined, loosely, as an attempt to find and demonstrate beauty in the grittiness of urban life, then this <em>Style Wars</em> scene cuts to the roots: find all the beauty you want, and people will still only see what they&#39;re trying to see.</p>

<h2>Hook</h2>

<h3>Spanish Lady</h3>

<p>From the <em>Style Wars</em> sample, the track moves on to the hook, which begins with a woman&#39;s voice: &quot;Escuchela: la ciudad respirando&quot; (which I roughly translate to, &#39;Listen to the city, it&#39;s breathing&#39;). I highlight this line, because it&#39;s this idea of the city&#39;s breath, implying an organic living city, that gives the song its name. I wish I knew what her voice was sampled from, &#39;cause I&#39;m sure it would be significant, but I can&#39;t seem to find it anywhere.</p>

<h3>Rapped Hook</h3>

<p>The rest of the hook continues the pulmonary analogy:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So much on my mind that I can&#39;t recline /
  Blastin&#39; holes in the night &#39;till she bled sunshine /
  Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine /
  Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline /
  Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call /
  I can&#39;t take it y&#39;all, I can feel the city breathin&#39; /
  Chest heavin&#39;, against the flesh of the evenin&#39; /
  Sigh before we die like the last train leavin&#39;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By anthropomorphizing the city like this, it becomes more human. This allows it to have a confused, confusing morality (like the ones humans have), and furthermore it allows the rappers to use the rich language normally reserved for describing people. Mos Def and Talib don&#39;t end up employing that very much, but Common&#39;s verse does.</p>

<h2>Mos Def&#39;s Verse</h2>

<p>Mos Def&#39;s verse seems somewhat paradoxical: he says a bunch of depressing shit about the city, and then concludes with a kind-of-beautiful image of &quot;the harbor lights which remain in the distance.&quot; In a way, Mos&#39; whole verse can be synechdocilly represented by his work with the big apple metaphor for New York City. Normally the image implies New York&#39;s deliciousness and sense of wonder, but Mos Def changes the metaphor to bring out negative aspects of apples: it is &quot;shiny&quot;, and &quot;bruised&quot;, and you &quot;could lose your teeth&quot;, and yet it&#39;s still &quot;sweet&quot;. Mos Def would probably argue that such a polarized good-and-bad description is necessary to &quot;describe the inscrutable&quot;.</p>

<h2>Talib&#39;s Verse</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog /
  Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Damn. Nuff said.</p>

<p>But seriously, Talib&#39;s verse plays with feelings of urban desolation and hopelessness. Contrast between dreams and deaths. The perennial grayness of a world where intra-gang success might feel like victory, but who are you really fighting against? &quot;everything is fair
/ It&#39;s a paradox we call reality&quot;</p>

<h2>Common&#39;s Verse</h2>

<p>Common&#39;s verse deals with the huge class disparity present in Chicago. The verse employs heavy juxtaposition to bring out this disparity: heaven / hell, project life / &quot;plush homes&quot; (Cabrini / <em>Love Jones</em>), hate / love. When this track was recorded, in 1998, the Cabrini-Green demolition was just beginning)</p>

<p>Commons&#39; is also the verse that takes the living-breathing-city analogy the farthest, with the line, &quot;knew my friend was gone for good / Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn&#39;t mask it.&quot; He seals the deal in the last four lines, switching references from &quot;the city&quot; to &quot;my man&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep /
  Of reality I touch, but for me it&#39;s hard to keep /
  Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep /
  Of reality I touch, but for me it&#39;s hard to keep</p>
</blockquote>
