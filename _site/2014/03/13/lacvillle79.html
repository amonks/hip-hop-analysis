<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Along with <em>What A Job</em> and <em>Doobie Ashtray</em>, <em>Lavcille &#39;79&#39;</em> is one of Devin The Dude&#39;s most successful singles. He produced the song himself and released it on his 2002 sophomore album, <em>Just Tryin&#39; To Live</em>.  It&#39;s a classic laid-back smoke-and-ride song.</p>

<h2>Context: Your Favorite Rapper&#39;s Favorite Rapper</h2>

<p>I first got into Devin after reading a <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/06/050606gore_GOAT_recordings1">brief but glowing introduction</a> to his work by the <em>New Yorker</em>&#39;s then new pop music columnist, the quite-astute Sasha Frere-Jones. Drawn in by an even ravier <a href="http://www.prefixmag.com/features/devin-the-dude/your-favorite-rappers-favorite-rapper/12400/">interview</a> in Prefixmag that called him, &quot;the greatest hip-hop artist you&#39;ve never heard,&quot; and went on to say he&#39;s, &quot;one of the most respected and sought-after artists in the industry. As one of the few emcees who has worked with the best in the underground, mainstream, East, West and South, &quot;indeed, his 2007 hit <em>What A Job</em> included both Andree 3000 and Snoop Dogg, and <em>Just Tryin To Live</em> had a feature from Nas and production from DJ Premier and Dr. Dre, &quot;Devin is your favorite rapper&#39;s favorite rapper&quot;. But who <em>is</em> Devin The Dude?</p>

<h2>Devin The Dude</h2>

<p>He&#39;s a rapper from Houston. Relegated to the underground. He raps about things he likes: weed, women, music, chillin&#39;. <a href="http://passionweiss.com/2013/10/25/devin-the-dude-on-the-road/">This random blog</a> said, &quot;His introspective and sometimes self-deprecating lyrics coupled with his sheepish grin make him a likable rap everyman.&quot; It went on to say that, &quot;Scarface has previously said that an artist should keep remaking the same album and carve a lane for themselves rather than trying to do something new. Despite that not always being true, Devin definitely followed this formula.&quot; <em>Lacville &#39;79</em> illustrates the everyman vibe.</p>

<h2>The song</h2>

<p><em>Lacville &#39;79</em> is named after Devin&#39;s shitty car: a 1979 Cadillac <em>Coup De Ville</em>. It starts off as if it&#39;s about smoking blunts and driving around, but then it swivels around the point when he says, &quot;I go about 47 in a 55&quot;. The Dude goes on to mention his problems with mechanics, how he, &quot;hear[s] bumps and crunks, pings and ticks and dings,&quot; and how people &quot;talk,&quot; &quot;diss,&quot; &quot;heckle,&quot; and &quot;laugh.&quot;</p>

<p>The chorus has a positive upbeat sound. He puts his problems in perspective: his car is too old to get stolen, and he&#39;s, &quot;smokin&#39; weed and feelin&#39; fine.&quot; Even in his shitty old car. It really is a song for the people.</p>
